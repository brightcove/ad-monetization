# Brightcove Ad Monetization

This repository contains public resources related to the Brightcove Ad Monetization product.

## ads.txt
This is the file that customers using Brightcove Ad Network must host at the ROOT of the domain trafficking ads. For example, if the company owns company.com, they would host ads.txt at https://company.com/ads.txt. The hosted file must contain all the values provided in our copy of ads.txt. They can have other values (likely only if they have ads from other providers), but at a minimum it must contain the values provided in this ads.txt in the format provided.

## app-ads.txt
The content of this file is exactly the same as ads.txt â€” it's just used within applications instead of websites.
